## The Repository

This repository was made from scratch to create a weather dashboard application with JavaScript and the APIs provided by OpenWeatherÂ®.

---

## Installation

The code may be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/choelzli/weather-app) or visiting the site URL (https://choelzli.github.io/weather-app/).

```
git clone https://github.com/choelzli/weather-app.git

## Usage

Upon accessing the webpage, it displays a header that contains a title, an input field to enter a city, and a search button.  Previously searched cities are shown immediately below the header as buttons.

After clicking the search button, if the city is listed in the OpenWeatherAPI, the current weather conditions and 5-day forecast are rendered to the page. If the user clicks on a city in the Search History, the current weather and forecast for that city will render to the page instead.
